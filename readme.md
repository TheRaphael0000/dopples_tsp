Application of the traveling salesman problem to the dopples in Dofus. A short project because I wanted to experiment with the TSP problem with teleportation (zaap in this case).

Solution:

I used the manhattan distance (the way we can move in the game) but without taking into account the "walls" for sake of simplicity.
For the final solution image I used "Euclidean lines", since it's clearer.

Notice that it's faster to haversack from the Sram temple to the -2,0 zaap then go to the huppermage, but i think it's overkill to render it in the final solution (the one i'll use).
